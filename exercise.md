**Introduction**

The objective of the practical work is that the student has the experience of building a solution to a problem using machine learning techniques. During the development of this, the student will have to work in groups and apply the techniques learned in class to train a model. The student is expected to be able to apply the techniques related to each stage of the construction of a machine learning model.

**Objectives**

* Choose a problem to solve using machine learning techniques.
* Obtain and model the data needed to solve the problem.
* Train and apply (predict) a machine learning model.
* Explain what would be the benefit of applying the machine learning based solution.

**Development**

For the development of the practical work, the group of students should choose one of the available datasets:
* Spotify songs (classification).
* Airline flight satisfaction (classification).
* House prices (regression).

Once the data set to work with has been defined, the following milestones must be followed:

1. EDA (exploratory data analysis). It must be presented in Jupyter Notebooks format and must have conclusions of the analysis performed.
2. Jupyter Notebook for model training. At least 3 different algorithms should be trained and the model used in production should be chosen and justified.
3. Final presentation of results. A final conclusion of the work performed is expected.

**Submissions**

Within the course, two delivery dates are planned, where the groups will have to comply with certain guidelines.

<u>Delivery of stage 1 of the integrative practical work</u>

The groups must present Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing:

* Description of the problem or situation to be solved in the dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The required and desirable elements are detailed in the EDA section. In addition to graphics, it is expected that the findings are explained.

<u>Final delivery of the practical work</u>

Groups should submit Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing:

* Training of 3 models.
* Conclusions of the performance of the models.

**Required for the deliveries**

<u>Delivery of stage 1 of the integrative practical work</u>

Required:

* Distributions of variables.
* Analysis / imputation of null values.
* Outliers analysis.
* Relation of features with the target.

Desirable:

* Correlations between variables.

<u>Final delivery of the practical work</u>
Required:

* Resolution methodology.
* Separation into training and validation data.
* Choice of metrics.
* Training of at least 3 different models.
* Confusion matrix (classification) / residual plot (regression).

Desirable:

* Pipelines.
* Hyperparameter tuning.
* Oversampling and Undersampling methods (applicable when the proportion of a class is low).

**Final delivery of the integrative practical work and synchronous oral defense**

Groups are expected to make a presentation (Power Point or similar) of the problem solved using machine learning. The focus should be based on the following 3 pillars:

1. Problem or initiative addressed.
2. Solving approach (methodology and techniques applied).
3. Evaluation of results.

Each group will have a maximum of 15 minutes to present, and, at the end, the professor will ask each group an individual question related to the project, which will define the grade of the practical work.
